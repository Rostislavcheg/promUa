## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Update the project's dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

2. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

3. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4. Optionally, seed the database with initial data:

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

After completing these steps, your project will be up and running. You can access the project at the address provided by the `php artisan serve` command.

Please make sure you have Composer installed and have configured your Laravel environment before proceeding.
